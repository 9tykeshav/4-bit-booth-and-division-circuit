# Logisim Implementation of Booth's Algorithm & Division Algorithms

This repository contains Logisim circuit designs for implementing **Booth's Algorithm** for multiplication, as well as **Restoring Division** and **Non-Restoring Division** algorithms for division. These implementations demonstrate a very easy and layman-friendly approach to the circuit design.

## Structure

- **Files in the root folder**: These are the implementation files of the circuits.
- **/schematics**: This folder contains the respective circuit diagrams/diagrams for each algorithm.

## How to Use These Circuits

1. **Clone the repository**:
   - Download the files or git clone the entire project.

2. **Open the circuits in Logisim**:
   - Download and install **Logisim** if you haven't already (available from [here](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/)).
   - Open any of the `.circ` files (e.g., `booth algorithm.circ`, `restoring division.circ`, or `non restoring division.circ`) in **Logisim**.

3. **Set all the constant values**:
   - Input the desired values for your multiplicand, multiplier, or divisor, depending on which circuit you're running.
   - Adjust the constant inputs in the circuit to match the test case you're working with.

This guide provides the basic steps to use the circuits. Feel free to experiment with different input values and modify the circuits as needed.
